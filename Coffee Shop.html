        <h1>Welcome to Bean & Brew</h1>
        <p>
          At Bean & Brew Café, we believe that every cup of coffee tells a
          story. Our expert baristas carefully craft each drink using ethically
          sourced beans from small farms around the world. Whether you're
          starting your morning, taking a midday break, or meeting friends for
          an afternoon chat, we have the perfect brew waiting for you. All our
          pastries are baked fresh daily using organic ingredients and
          traditional recipes passed down through generations.
