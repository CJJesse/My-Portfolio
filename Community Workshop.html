        <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
        <p>
          Join us for a full day of learning about sustainable gardening
          practices in our local climate. This workshop is designed for
          community members of all skill levels who want to start growing fresh
          vegetables, herbs, and flowers at home. Our experienced instructors
          will guide you through everything from soil preparation to harvest
          techniques, ensuring you leave with practical knowledge you can apply
          immediately in your own garden or balcony containers.

          Throughout the day, you'll participate in hands-on demonstrations
          covering essential gardening topics. We'll explore how to test and
          improve your soil quality, choose the right plants for each season,
          implement water-saving irrigation methods, and manage pests naturally
          without harmful chemicals. You'll also learn about companion planting
          techniques that help your garden thrive and maximize your growing
          space, whether you have a large backyard or just a small patio
